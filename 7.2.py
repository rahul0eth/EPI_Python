# Reverse sublist of linked list

# Constraints and assumptions:
# List fits on system memory
# linked lists are unsorted
# lists are singly linked

# test cases:
# test case 1
# head = M; Input List = M -> 11 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 2
# reverse elements 2nd through 4th
# Output List = M -> 11 -> 7 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2

# Naive approach:
# //TODO
